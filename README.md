# SMASH-Rising x DoorDash

While working as a SMASH Rising Intern for DoorDash, I had the opportunity to work alongside: Alfredo Alcala Jr., Mya Williams, 

Tyree Harding, and Zaria Maloof as we worked to improve the Dasher Experience. With our Location Profile, Dashers would be able 

to more accurately navigate to complex buildings such as apartments, college campuses, hospitals, etc. View our website to look 

through our prototype and find out more about our idea!
